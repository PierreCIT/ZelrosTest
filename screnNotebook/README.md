#What is it ?
------
Because the notebooks requires some data loading and different libraries I saved the HTML/CSS once the notebooks run were completed.
</br>
This prevents to run the full code to get an idea of the outputs and how the code works in general.</br>

#How to see it ?
------
To see it, clone the repo and open one of the 2 HTML files (1 for each version of the code: vanilla and improved) in your web browser.
It should be displaid properly as a Jupyter Notebook.
